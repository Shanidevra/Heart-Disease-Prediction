# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Prediction of heart disease is a very recent field as the data is becoming available. Other researchers have approached it with different techniques and methods. We used data analytics to detect and predict diseaseâ€™s patients. Starting with a pre-processing phase, where we selected the most relevant features by the correlation matrix, then we applied three data analytics techniques (neural networks, SVM and KNN) on data sets of different sizes, in order to study the accuracy and stability of each of them.

# Key Components of Heart Disease Prediction:
# Dataset
The prediction model is trained on datasets that include various health metrics such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, body mass index (BMI), and smoking habits. Popular datasets include UCI Heart Disease, Framingham dataset, etc.

# Machine Learning Models: 
Various classification models are used to predict heart disease. These include:
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful algorithm for classification, especially with high-dimensional data.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm.
Neural Networks: Used for more complex relationships in data.

# Data Preprocessing: 
This step involves cleaning the data by handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

# Model Training and Evaluation:
The model is trained on historical data using the training set.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC are used to assess the performance of the model.

# Conclusion
The conclusion of a heart disease prediction study is a critical section where you summarize key findings, discuss their implications, and highlight the contributions of your research. Here is a structured approach to writing the conclusion In this paper, a comparative analysis of different classifiers was done for the classification of the Heart Disease dataset for positive and negative diagnosed participants. The algorithms were used K- Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Naive Bayes, SVM and Decision Table (DT) classifiers.
